#' The package provides a function which returns the rfPred score for a list of 
#' non-synonymous missense variants. All the rfPred scores are pre-calculated and 
#' stored in a \code{TabixFile} available on a server and which can be downloaded 
#' for using the package while not connected on the Internet. The package does not 
#' work without an access to the \code{TabixFile}. However, a toy example on the 
#' chromosome Y is available within the package to test the \code{rfPred_scores} function.
#' curves with numbers of subjects at risk, compare data sets, display spaghetti-plot, build multi-contingency tables...
